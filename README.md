# Fast Estimation of Morphing Wing Flight Dynamics Using Neural Networks and Cubature Rules
This is the companion code for the parallel and circular formation control method reported in the paper Fast Estimation of Morphing Wing Flight Dynamics
Using Neural Networks and Cubature Rules by Paul Ghanem et al, CDC 2023. The paper can be found here (https://css.paperplaza.net/images/temp/CDC/files/1527.pdf). The code allows the users to reproduce the results reported in the paper. Please cite the above paper when reporting, reproducing or extending the results.
